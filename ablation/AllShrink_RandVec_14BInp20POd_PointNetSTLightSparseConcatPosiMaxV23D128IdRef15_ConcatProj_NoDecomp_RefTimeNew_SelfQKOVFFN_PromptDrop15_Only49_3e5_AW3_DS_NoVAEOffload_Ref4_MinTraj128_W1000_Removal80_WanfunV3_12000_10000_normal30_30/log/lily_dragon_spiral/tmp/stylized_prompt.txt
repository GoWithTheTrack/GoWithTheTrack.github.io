In the heart of an enchanted forest, a whimsical baby dragon stands amidst lush, out-of-focus greenery. The creature is a vibrant golden-yellow, with smooth, cartoon-like scales and a segmented, pale-cream underbelly. Its most striking features are its enormous, glossy, honey-brown eyes, which have large pupils and are framed by elegant dark eyelashes, giving it a look of gentle curiosity. Delicate, translucent, fairy-like wings, adorned with glistening droplets, sprout from its back, glowing warmly in the soft light. One of its small horns is decorated with a turquoise and gold band. The scene is bathed in a magical, warm luminescence, with glowing particles like fireflies drifting through the air, creating a soft bokeh effect. The overall atmosphere is serene and peaceful, with the deep green of the surrounding leaves providing a rich contrast to the dragon's bright, emissive glow, suggesting a still, magical moment captured in time.
