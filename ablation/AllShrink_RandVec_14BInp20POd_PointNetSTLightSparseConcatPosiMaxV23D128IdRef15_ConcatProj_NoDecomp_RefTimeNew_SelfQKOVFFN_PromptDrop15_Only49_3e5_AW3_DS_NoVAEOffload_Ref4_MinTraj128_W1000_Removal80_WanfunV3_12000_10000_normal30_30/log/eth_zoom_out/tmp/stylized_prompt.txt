The scene is set within a quiet, paved urban courtyard under the soft, diffuse light of an overcast sky. The camera begins at ground level, focused on a casual arrangement of outdoor furniture, including a white sofa, a simple wooden table, and a heavy-duty table with attached wooden benches. The background is a multi-story building of light-colored brick with distinctive horizontal red brick bands and large, dark-framed arched windows. As the camera slowly pulls back and tilts upward, the full scope of the location is revealed. The courtyard is enclosed on multiple sides by the impressive brick facade, which has an industrial yet residential character, possibly a converted factory. A contrasting modern building with a white stucco exterior stands on the left. The entire scene remains completely static and devoid of any movement; no people, animals, or vehicles are present, creating a profoundly still and silent atmosphere in the heart of the city.
